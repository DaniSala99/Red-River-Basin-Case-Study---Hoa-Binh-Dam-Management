# MATLAB Requirements for Red River Basin Dam Management

## MATLAB Version
- **Minimum**: R2020a
- **Recommended**: R2021a or later
- **Tested on**: R2020a, R2021b, R2022a

## Required Toolboxes

### Essential (Project Won't Run Without These)
- **Optimization Toolbox** - For NSGA-II and optimization algorithms
- **Deep Learning Toolbox** (formerly Neural Network Toolbox) - For ANN forecast model
- **Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox** - For statistical analysis and cross-validation

### Recommended (For Full Functionality)
- **Parallel Computing Toolbox** - For faster optimization (optional but recommended)
- **Curve Fitting Toolbox** - For data preprocessing and analysis

## Verification

To verify your MATLAB installation has the required toolboxes, run:

```matlab
% Check MATLAB version
version

% List installed toolboxes
ver

% Check specific toolboxes
license('test','Optimization_Toolbox')
license('test','Neural_Network_Toolbox')
license('test','Statistics_Toolbox')
```

## Alternative Solutions

If you don't have access to all toolboxes:

### For Neural Networks
- Consider using open-source alternatives (but code modification required):
  - Python with TensorFlow/PyTorch (requires code translation)
  - Octave with neural network packages (limited compatibility)

### For Optimization
- Basic genetic algorithm can be implemented from scratch (provided in NSGA2 folder)
- Consider using optimization-free approaches for initial exploration

## External Dependencies

### Data Files (Not Included - User Must Provide)
The project requires historical data files in the following directories:
- `data/` - Streamflow and precipitation time series
- `sim/` - Simulation model functions
- `STD/` - Standard Operating Policy functions
- `RBF/` - Radial Basis Function utilities
- `NSGA2/` - NSGA-II algorithm implementation
- `divisione/` - Additional utility functions

### Expected Data Format
- Time series should be in MATLAB-compatible formats (.mat, .txt, .csv)
- Daily time step
- Variables should include:
  - Hoa Binh inflow (m³/s)
  - Thao River flow (m³/s)
  - Lo River flow (m³/s)
  - Precipitation at various stations (mm)
  - Reservoir level (m)

## Installation Checklist

- [ ] MATLAB R2020a or later installed
- [ ] Optimization Toolbox available
- [ ] Deep Learning Toolbox available
- [ ] Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox available
- [ ] Repository cloned
- [ ] All subfolders added to MATLAB path
- [ ] Data files placed in appropriate directories
- [ ] Test script runs without errors

## System Requirements

### Minimum Hardware
- **Processor**: Intel Core i5 or equivalent
- **RAM**: 8 GB
- **Storage**: 2 GB free space
- **OS**: Windows 10, macOS 10.14+, or Linux

### Recommended Hardware
- **Processor**: Intel Core i7 or better
- **RAM**: 16 GB or more (for faster optimization)
- **Storage**: 5 GB free space (including results)
- **OS**: Latest Windows 10/11, macOS, or Ubuntu

## Performance Notes

- **Forecast Model Training**: 5-30 minutes depending on hardware
- **NSGA-II Optimization**: 20-60 minutes (70 pop, 50 gen)
- **Full Script Execution**: 1-2 hours for complete analysis
- **Parallel Computing**: Can reduce optimization time by 50-70%

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Undefined function or variable"
- **Solution**: Ensure all subfolders are added to path
- Run: `addpath(genpath('path/to/project'))`

**Issue**: "Out of memory"
- **Solution**: 
  - Close other applications
  - Reduce population size or generations in NSGA-II
  - Use `clear` command between script sections

**Issue**: "License checkout failed"
- **Solution**: Verify toolbox license with `ver` command
- Contact your MATLAB administrator

**Issue**: Neural network training very slow
- **Solution**:
  - Reduce number of neurons or training iterations
  - Enable GPU acceleration if available
  - Reduce dataset size for initial testing

## Updates and Compatibility

This project is tested with MATLAB releases up to R2023b. Future MATLAB versions should maintain backward compatibility, but please report any issues.
